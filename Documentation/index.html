    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Follyverse and Tames are the outputs of a postdoctoral project at MoLab, Department of Digital Modelling, within the Faculty of Architecture of Czech Technical University, Prague. Their purpose is to enable architectural researchers and students to create and publish interactive, immersive and dynamic presentation and 3D surveys without worrying about the complexities of graphics and gaming programming.</p>
    <p>The project started with Tames, a toolkit in Unity that was named so as it supposedly <i>tamed</i> game objects (hence, its original basic class was <i>Tame</i>Object, a naming convention which remained and spread to other classes). Please bear with this naming :). Then, to modularise its web access, the Follyverse was added. Follyverse is the collective title for two Unity projects Folly Server and Folly Hub. The latter is a dedicated server app and the latter is an interface to run Tames' exported projects offline or online. The name <i>Folly</i> was selected because at that stage of the project, the presumption was that only one building/project will be loaded at a time without its context (hence a folly, in architectural sense). </p>
    
    <h2>What do you need?</h2>
    <p>The better question would be <b>"what would you like to do?"</b>. There are a few possibilities:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Creating</b> projects: if you only wish to create projects, you don't need to bother with Follyverse. Only check <a href="#tames">Tames Toolkit</a> below.</li>
            <li><b>Viewing</b> projects: for viewing Tames projects created by others, you'd better use <a href="#folly">Folly Hub</a>. It's safer and faster. If the projects are browser-based (WebGL), you won't even need that; just your web browser will suffice.</li>
            <li><b>Creating</b> and <b>viewing</b> projects: then you need both <a href="#tames">TamesToolkit</a> and <a href="#folly">Folly Hub</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Hosting</b> a server: you would need to use Folly Server.</li>
        </ul>
        Of course, there are what you'll need only from Tames' side. There will be other requirements regarding VR and server settings (see <a href="#download">Prerequisites</a>).</p>
    <p>In this documentation, the basics of using both Tames Toolkit and Follyverse apps are explained. The documentation is not complete yet but will be constantly improved and updated.</p>
